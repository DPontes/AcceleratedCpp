# Notes on the chapter

From the book: _In this chapter, we're going to make the program more flexible so that we can change the size of the frame without rewriting the program._

## 2.4 - Writing a row
From the book: _The reason we have given `cols` a type of `std::string::size\_type` is to ensure that `cols` is capable of containing the number of characters in `greeting`, no matter how large the number might be. [...] we have no control over how long the input might be._
